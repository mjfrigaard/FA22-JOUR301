The coefficient estimate (Coef.) for exercise shows that average baseline glucose levels were about 1.7 mg/dL lower among women who exercised at least three times a week than among women who exercised less. This
difference is statistically significant (t = -3.87;P < 0:0005).

-we see that in a multiple regression model that adjusts for age, alcohol use (drinkany), and BMI, average glucose is estimated to be only about 1mg/dL lower among women who exercise (95% CI 0.1â€“1.8, P D 0:027), holding the other three factors constant

-the multipredictor model also shows that average glucose levels are about 0.7mg/dL higher among alcohol
users than among nonusers.

-average levels also increase by about 0.5mg/dL per unit increase in BMI, and by 0.06mg/dL for each additional year of age. 

-each of these associations is statistically significant after adjustment for the other predictors in
the model.
