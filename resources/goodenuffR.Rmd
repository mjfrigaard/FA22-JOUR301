The `goodenuffR` package helps you organize your files and folders. This document is meant to guide you through HW2 and serve as a reference for future use. 

# Install `goodenuffR` using the code below: 

```{r install-goodenuffR, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mjfrigaard/goodenuffR")
```

# 1) Create a course folder 

Somewhere on your computer (**not your Downloads/ folder**), create a folder for this course. Follow the naming conventions covered in the [intro slides](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/FA22-JOUR301/slides/intro-to-files-directories.html#1) or [this great lecture.](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~rcs46/lectures_2015/01-markdown-git/slides/naming-slides/naming-slides.pdf).

Let's assume I've chosen to create my course folder in my `Dropbox/` and I've named it `FA22-JOUR301/`

```{r , eval=FALSE}
└── Dropbox/
      └── FA22-JOUR301/
```

# 2) Create an assignments folder 

Inside your course folder, create a sub-folder for the assignments.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
└── Dropbox/
      └── FA22-JOUR301/
               └── hw/
```

*Before* navigating to the [Assignments menu]() on the course website, I want to create a folder for any homework files.  

# 3) Get your working directory

I start by getting the current working directory in RStudio: 

```{r , eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

```
# [1] "/Users/mjfrigaard/R/"
```

This tells me where RStudio is currently 'looking' for files. I know I created the course folder in my `Dropbox/` folder, so I can navigate to the folder using the `dir()` function. 

`dir()` is a handy function because we can take advantage of RStudio's tab-completion by entering the beginning of the path (`"/Users/mjfrigaard/Dropbox/"`) and hitting the tab key to see what other folders are available. 

```{r dir-tab-completion, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dir-tab-completion.png")
```

# 4) Create your HW project

Once we have the path to the homework folder, we can use the `goodenuffR::goodenuff_project()` function to create the new project. 

```{r dir-tab-completion-02, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dir-tab-completion-02.png")
```

The **`project_name`** is name of the project, which is a sub-folder in **`folder_path`** argument. See the example below:

```{r goodenuff_project, eval=FALSE}
goodenuffR::goodenuff_project(
  project_name = "wk2-goodenuffR-assignment", 
  folder_path =  "/Users/mjfrigaard/Dropbox/FA22-JOUR301/hw/")
```

This should open a new RStudio session. In the **Console** pane, you should see the name of the new project and the folder path. 

```{r new-goodenuffR-console-pane, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, out.width='100%', out.height='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-goodenuffR-console-pane.png")
```

In the **Files** pane, you should see the folder path and your new RStudio project file (with the `.Rproj` extension).

```{r new-goodenuffR-file-pane, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, out.width='100%', out.height='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-goodenuffR-file-pane.png")
```

# 5) Create your HW folders 

In the R console, run the `goodenuffR::goodenuff_files()` function to create the files and folders. 

```{r goodenuff_files, eval=FALSE}
goodenuffR::goodenuff_files()
```

This creates the follow files and folder (you can see them in the **Files** pane): 

```{r new-goodenuffR-new-files, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, out.width='100%', out.height='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/new-goodenuffR-new-files.png")
```

## 6) Download the HW Assignment 

Now we're ready to head over to the course website and download the Assignment for HW 2. We can save this file the top-level folder as:
