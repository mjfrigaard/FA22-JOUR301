Take note of excluded participants and sample size:

Limitations aren't always reported in the **limitations** section:

> "*A sample of 100 autistic individuals (50 per condition) was sought. Power analysis using GPower indicated that a sample of 50 per condition afforded above 90% power to detect medium effect sizes*"
