The course will introduce\nstudents to the R programming language, data manipulation, and\nvisualizations.\nStudent Learning Outcomes\nWhat is data journalism (and why it exists)\nData science technologies\nCommon sources for data (open datasets, websites, etc.)\nUsing R for data manipulation\nA grammar of graphics\nCreating data visualizations\nIdentifying good, bad, ugly, and wrong data visualizations\nWhat this course is about\nThis course is about data visualizations and how to reason about and\ncommunicate with data visualizations. A substantial portion of this\ncourse is dedicated to the underlying technologies behind data\nvisualizations (R code, markdown, and data in various formats). Students\nwill learn to combine code and prose with visualizations into\nreproducible outputs (such as html reports, websites or blogs).\nTopics\nData science technologies\nMethods for data storage, extraction and manipulation\nPerforming basic data summaries\nCreating and interpreting data visualizations\nData Journalism requires both theoretical and practical applications of\nstatistical summaries and visualizations. The theoretical, here, is\nconcerned with what is required to determine the truth about a topic,\nand how to present that truth in a compelling and comprehensible way to\nyour audience. The practical application addresses how data are\ncollected, stored, retrieved, manipulated and analyzed in the pursuit of\nthat truth. Because of the wide range of topics and technical details\nrequired to do this work, it’s imperative that students commit to\nattending class, completing readings and homework, and consult me if and\nwhen difficulties arise.\nFurther, this is a course in a professional program. This means that\nstudents approach this coursework as they would a professional\ncommitment with timeliness (in attendance and submission of\nassignments), responsibilities (to readings and assignments), and\nrespectful interactions with others in the course.\nBy taking this course, students commit to attending every meeting\n(absent medical documentation) and arriving in class prepared and\non-time. This course meets only sixteen times, which necessitates\nstudent attendance for comprehension of material. Therefore, attendance\nis mandatory and each missed meeting (sans medical documentation) will\nresult in final grade reduction of one full letter grade. There will be\nopportunities to make up missed assignments and absences throughout the\ncourse.\nAssignments and grading\nThis course requires that students attend class to learn basic data\nmanipulation and data visualization skills. Therefore, much of the\nstudent evaluation, besides the weekly exercises conducted to ensure\ncomprehension, is based on participation and the data journalism\nprojects.\nHomework and exercises (50%): These are in-class exercises and\nhomework assignments. Each missed exercise after the first will cost the\nstudent a full letter grade for the course. Completion of these\nassignments is obligatory.\nProject 1 (25%): Reproduce a data visualization and provide\naccompanying narrative. This project gives students an opportunity to\npractice data manipulation, visualization, graphing techniques,\npresentation and framing. Length: 1,200-1,500 words.\nProject 2 (25%): Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project. Students\nwill choose from a list of data sources, create a sequence of data\nvisualizations and displays, and provide related commentary and\nnarrative. This project will be published online. This project requires\nthe student to use the R programming to examine an issue of social\nsignificance. Length: 1,200-1,500 words.\nI will keep the gradebook current in Blackboard. If you have difficulty\nwith material or concepts, please contact me. There will be many\nopportunities to review material individually, but I need to be aware of\nany such difficulties.\nThe Weekly Agenda\nWe meet once a week, during which I give a brief lecture, following a\ndiscussion. We will then walk-through ‘live coding’ activities that\ndemonstrate how to collect, clean and visualize a variety of data types.\nThe last portion of class can be used to complete the assigned\nactivities for the week. Exercises are due at the end of each week, and\ncompletion will constitute your participation grade for that week.\nPrior to our meeting each week, there will be assigned readings. There\nwill be a quiz on this material given immediately at the beginning of\neach week’s class.\nPlagiarism\nIn this course, we are following standard definitions of plagiarism that\ninclude: no copying of text (verbatim or partial), no introduction of\nsomeone else’s idea without attribution, no use of someone else’s\nintellectual property without consent and clear attribution of source.\nCheating on any quiz or exam will be considered a similar violation.\nWriting code\nStudents will encounter a fair amount of code in this course. While this\nis not a programming course, it’s standard practice to use code snippets\nfrom online resources like StackOverflow or online vignettes. R is an\nopen-source programming language, and reusing code encourages\ncollaborators to build on the work of others. Therefore, students are\nencouraged to copy and paste code from other sources. However, this code\nusually needs to be adapted to fit a particular use. This is the one\nexception to the plagiarism policy. All story text and photos must be\nexclusively your own. I loathe dishonesty, in nearly every form and\ncircumstance. I will immediately fail and request the maximum possible\npunishment for any student that violates these policies.\nBooks and materials\nData Journalism texts:\nThe Data Journalism Handbook, Gray, et al., (2012).

Students are expected to have consistent high-speed Internet\navailability and have access to a computer with modern processing\ncapabilities (open lab is available for those without such a machine).\nDisabilities\nIf you have a disability and require special accommodations, please see\nme to discuss possible arrangements with ARC.\nGrading\nAll tests, quizzes and large presentations will be graded on a 100-point\nscale. All percentages are rounded to the nearest whole percent. Letter\ngrades are based on the following scale:\nGrading scale\nPercentage\nGrade\n92 and above\nA\n90-91\nA-\n88-89\nB+\n82-87\nB\n80-81\nB-\n78-79\nC+\n72-77\nC\n70-71\nC-\n68-69\nD+\n60-67\nD\nbelow 60\nF\n\n\n\n",
